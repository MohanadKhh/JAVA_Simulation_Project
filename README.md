# JAVA Simulation Project
## Description
A real-time software system that opens Simulink MDL files in a Java based GUI

The tool is made up of two main things: 
 1. a file reader that understands MDL files
 2. a user interface built with Java
 
 The file reader reads the MDL file and gets all the important information like diagrams and connections. 
 The user interface shows the model in an easy-to-understand way and lets us interact with it.
 
 ## Features of the program include:
 First: run the program:
 The graphical user interface (GUI) of the program will appear on the screen
 ##
 Second: file managment:
 Loading Simulink MDL Files: 
 The program allows us to import Simulink MDL files, which contain the model information.
 ##
 Third: Structure Display and model Visualization: 
 -The program will display the contents of the MDL file in a hierarchical structure. 
 -The GUI provides a visual representation of the model components such as block diagrams, parameters, and connections. 
 ##
 forth:Real-time Visualization: 
 When we make changes to the model interactively, the program will immediately update the visualization to reflect those changes.
