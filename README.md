## Description
A real-time software system that opens Simulink MDL files in a Java based GUI

The tool is made up of two main things: 
 1. a file reader that understands MDL files
 2. a user interface built with Java
 
 The file reader reads the MDL file and gets all the important information like diagrams and connections. 
 <br>
 The user interface shows the model in an easy-to-understand way and lets us interact with it.
 
 
 ## Features of the program include:
 First: run the program:
 <br>
 The graphical user interface (GUI) of the program will appear on the screen
 ##
 Second: file managment:
 <br>
 Loading Simulink MDL Files: 
 <br>
 The program allows us to import Simulink MDL files, which contain the model information.
 ##
 Third: Structure Display and model Visualization: 
 <br>
 -The program will display the contents of the MDL file in a hierarchical structure. 
 <br>
 -The GUI provides a visual representation of the model components such as block diagrams, parameters, and connections. 
 ##
 forth:Real-time Visualization: 
 <br>
 When we make changes to the model interactively, the program will immediately update the visualization to reflect those changes.
